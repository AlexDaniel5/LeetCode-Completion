### Description
First, complete the same two processes as in yesterday's LeetCode challenge (isPalindrome): finding the middle of the linked list and reversing the second half of the linked list. Subsequently, we establish temporary pointers and reorder the list as specified. Overall, this problem felt straightforward and leaned more towards the easy level rather than being a medium-level challenge.

### LeetCode Description
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:
    L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:
    L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → ...
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.
