Description:
We create a matrix as displayed in LeetCode, with a column of characters followed by a diagonal leading to another column of characters.
Then, we can receive the answer string by reading the matrix from the top-left to the bottom-right. Overall, this problem is straightforward,
just reviewing how a double pointer operates.
