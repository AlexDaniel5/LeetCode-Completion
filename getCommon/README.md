### Description
Iterate through both arrays. If the element in the first list is smaller than the corresponding element in the second list, increase the index for the first list; vice versa for the second list. If the elements match, return them.

### LeetCode Description
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, return the minimum integer common to both arrays. If there is no common integer amongst nums1 and nums2, return -1.

Note that an integer is said to be common to nums1 and nums2 if both arrays have at least one occurrence of that integer.
