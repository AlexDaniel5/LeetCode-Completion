### Description
Utilize BFS search to sequentially add nodes from the tree by level, starting from the right and moving towards the left. As a result, the last value appended to the list will represent the bottom-left value, which can be returned at the end of the while loop.

## Notes
- I referenced my maze app to remember how BFS search works.
