### Description
Iterate through the list, maintaining a running sum for the current iteration. Whenever a number is smaller than or equal to the previous number, reset the sum and compare it to the greatest sum encountered so far. At the end, make sure to check if the current sum is greater than the greatest sum.

### LeetCode Description
Given an array of positive integers nums, return the maximum possible sum of an ascending subarray in nums.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous sequence of numbers in an array.

A subarray [numsl, numsl+1, ..., numsr-1, numsr] is ascending if for all i where l <= i < r, numsi  < numsi+1. Note that a subarray of size 1 is ascending.
