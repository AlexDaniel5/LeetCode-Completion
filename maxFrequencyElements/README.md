### Description
Create a hash table to identify the frequency of each number in the array. Sort the hash table by the frequency (value). Pick the first element in the hash table as it will have the highest frequency. Then iterate through the list checking if each key has the same value, if it does add it to the output.

### LeetCode Description
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such that those elements all have the maximum frequency.

The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.
