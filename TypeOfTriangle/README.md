### Description
First, sort the three numbers to simplify the triangle validity check. Then, determine the triangle type by comparing the side lengths; whether all sides are equal, two are equal, or all are different.

### LeetCode Description
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size 3 which can form the sides of a triangle.

    A triangle is called equilateral if it has all sides of equal length.
    A triangle is called isosceles if it has exactly two sides of equal length.
    A triangle is called scalene if all its sides are of different lengths.

Return a string representing the type of triangle that can be formed or "none" if it cannot form a triangle.
