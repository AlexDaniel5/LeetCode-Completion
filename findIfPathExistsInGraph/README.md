### Description
This is a standard depth-first search algorithm commonly used for graph traversal and path finding. It efficiently explores the graph from the source node, marking visited nodes to prevent revisiting them and ensuring a comprehensive search for a valid path to the destination node.

### LeetCode Description
There is a bi-directional graph with n vertices, where each vertex is labeled from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

You want to determine if there is a valid path that exists from vertex source to vertex destination.

Given edges and the integers n, source, and destination, return true if there is a valid path from source to destination, or false otherwise.
