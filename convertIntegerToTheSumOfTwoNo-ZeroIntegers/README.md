### Description
Iterate from 1 to N, setting a = i and b = i - a. Convert a and b to strings, and if neither contains a 0, return the list.

### LeetCode Description
No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.

Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:

    a and b are No-Zero integers.
    a + b = n

The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.
