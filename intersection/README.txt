### Description
Transform the initial array into a hashmap to achieve constant-time searches. Subsequently, for each element in the second array, verify its presence in the hashmap, remove it to prevent duplicates, and add it to the result array.

## Notes
- Similar problem to getCommon, but in this solution, I opt for the hashmap approach instead of the array-based two-pointer method.

### LeetCode Description
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.
